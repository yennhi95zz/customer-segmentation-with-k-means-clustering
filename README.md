# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This repository contains code examples and a blog post about K-means clustering. K-means clustering is a machine learning technique used to group data points into clusters based on their similarity. It's a popular unsupervised learning algorithm and can be used for a wide range of applications, from customer segmentation to image compression.

# 1. Introduction
The [K-Means Clustering: Exploring Advantages, Limitations, and Real-World Examples](https://medium.com/@yennhi95zz/k-means-clustering-exploring-advantages-limitations-and-real-world-examples-ac8234a803c6) is the main blog post that explains the basics of K-means clustering, its advantages and limitations, and provides real-world examples of its applications. The blog post includes Python code examples and data storytelling.

The `customer-segmentation-with-k-means-clustering.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the Python code used in the blog post to perform K-means clustering on a customer segmentation dataset. The notebook includes data visualization and clustering code.

Data source: [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle.

# 2. Installation
To run the Python code examples, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook and Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the dataset from the repository or use your own dataset.

To install Jupyter Notebook and Python 3, you can follow the instructions on the official Jupyter Notebook website: https://jupyter.org/install.html

# 3. Usage
Once you have Jupyter Notebook and Python 3 installed, you can open the customer_segmentation.ipynb notebook and run the code examples.

The notebook includes the following sections:

- Importing libraries and loading the dataset
- Visualizing the data
- Performing K-means clustering
- Visualizing the clusters
- Data storytelling

The Python code examples demonstrate how K-means clustering can be used to perform customer segmentation and how the results can be visualized and used to gain insights.
